# Disclaimer

Yes... I do use windows. Not only when I'm forced too but also on my own will (I'm a gamer too).

So at least I try to make it pretty.

# Dependencies

## GlazeWM

[cf Repo](https://github.com/glzr-io/glazewm)

### ZeBar

It comes with GlazeWM installer. Nothing actually useful, just keeps track of workspaces and reminds me of XFCE somehow...

## PowerToysRun

[Cf Doc](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/powertoys/run)

Assign "Win+F" to open Finder (avoid conflicts with Alt+Space)

# Tips

## Wallpapers

Find an [awesome one](https://wallhaven.cc/), or a collection of it and set a slideshow to change.

*Warnings*
 * Be sure to only have SFW wallpapers, you pervert!
 * Some companies might set their ugly corporate wallpaper as default: but there is always a [hack](https://superuser.com/questions/966650/path-to-current-desktop-backgrounds-in-windows-10)
