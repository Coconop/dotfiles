# dotfiles

Let me cook

Highly experimental terminal-based config.

Most configuration is meant to be symlinked to `$HOME`.

# Dependencies

* `sudo` permission on your machine
* _github.com_ access (direct or via proxy)

# Install

```
$ git clone https://github.com/Coconop/dotfiles.git
$ cd dotfiles
```

Explore and launch desired `install.sh` and/or `linkme.sh` (might explode)

# Disclaimer

This is my own backup that I constantly tweak: it is never meant to be stable.
It can serve as inspiration for your own config though.
